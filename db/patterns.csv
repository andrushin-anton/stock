DOJI,"What does it look like? It looks like a cross, with the same opening and closing prices. What does it mean? Simple. In a Doji candlestick, price is essentially unchanged. Hence, it represents market indecision. How do we trade it?  1. Trade it like a reversal signal (if there is a trend to reverse)
Treat it as a signal to stand aside (if there is no trend to reverse)"
HARAMI,"What does it look like? Just remember that Harami means pregnant in old Japanese. The first candlestick is the mother, and the second candlestick is the baby.

Focus on their bodies. The body of the baby bar must be entirely within the body of the mother bar.

Typically, in a bullish Harami, the first bar closes lower than it opens while the second bar closes higher. Similarly, in a bearish Harami, the first bar closes higher than it opens while the second bar closes lower.

What does it mean?

It means that the market has come to a muted reversal.

The candle body stands for the real price change of the candle regardless of its intra-candle excursions. Hence, it represents the real and conclusive movement of the candlestick. The smaller candle bodies points to decreased volatility. How do we trade it?

In a bull trend, use the bullish Harami to pinpoint the end of bearish retracement.
In a bear trend, use the bearish Harami to pinpoint the end of bullish retracement."
ENGULFING,"What does it look like?Simply flip a Harami pattern horizontally and you will get an Engulfing pattern.

The body of the second candle completely engulfs the body of the first.

What does it mean?

Again, the focus on the candle bodies looks for real reversal. In this case, the second candle body fully engulfs the first and represents a strong reversal signal.

How do we trade it?

In a bull trend, buy above the bullish Engulfing pattern for bullish continuation.
In a bear trend, sell below the bearish Engulfing pattern for bearish continuation."
DARK_CLOUD_COVER,"What does it look like? The Piercing Line and the Dark Cloud Cover refer to the bullish and bearish variants of the same two-bar pattern.

The first candlestick of the Piercing Line pattern is bearish. The second candlestick: Opens below the low of the first candlestick; and
Closes above the mid-point of the first candlestick. As for the Dark Cloud Cover pattern, the first candlestick is bullish. The second candlestick:

Opens above the high of the first candlestick; and
Closes below the mid-point of the first candlestick.
Due to the first criterion of both patterns, the second bar must open with a gap away from the close of the first bar. Hence, these candlestick patterns are unusual in intraday time-frames where gaps are uncommon. What does it mean? It means some traders are sorely disappointed.

In the Piercing Line pattern, the second bar opened with a gap down, giving an initial hope of a strong bearish follow-through. However, not only did the bearishness fail to materialise, it proceeded to erase more than half of the bearish gains from the first bar. This bullish shock offers a great long trade.

Likewise in the Dark Cloud Cover pattern, the first gap up prompted hope from the bulls before the lower close crushed it. How do we trade it?

Find major bullish reversals with the Piercing Line pattern (preferably after a break of a bear trend line)
Find major bearish reversals with Dark Cloud Cover pattern (preferably after a break of a bear trend line)"
